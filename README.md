Flappy Showdown: Pipe Escape is a Flappy Bird-inspired game built using OpenGL only in Python,with all drawing algorithms implemented from scratch. Players navigate pipe obstacles, but upon reaching a set score, they face a bullet-hell survival boss fight, dodging projectiles and attacking with limited shots. No game enginesâ€”only OpenGL.
