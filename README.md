Flappy Showdown: Pipe Escape is a Flappy Bird-inspired game built entirely using OpenGL in Python, with all drawing algorithms implemented from scratch—no external game engines were used. Players start by navigating classic pipe obstacles, requiring precise flapping mechanics. However, upon reaching a specific score, the gameplay shifts into an intense shootout survival boss fight.

The boss battle introduces bullet-hell-style attacks, forcing players to dodge projectiles, lasers, and shockwaves while trying to land hits using limited shooting abilities. The longer the player survives, the higher the final score, with victory being extremely rare but rewarding.

Key Features:
✅ Pure OpenGL Implementation – No third-party game engines, just OpenGL.
✅ Custom Drawing Algorithms – Pipes, player, and boss visuals coded from scratch.
✅ Classic Flappy Bird Mechanics – Simple tap-to-flap movement with tight controls.
✅ Epic Boss Fight – Survive an action-packed aerial battle with bullet-hell dodging.
